## What is Git and Github?

Git is an `open-source version control system` used to **track changes** in source code. It has the ability to manage both large and small projects, with efficient speed and accuracy. GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for software development using Git.

Git is designed to be `simple yet powerful`, allowing developers to `record change sets` that can `easily be identified`. While Git is mainly used as a command-line tool, GitHub provides tailored user interfaces, including graphical desktop and web applications. 

The main use of Git and GitHub is to `store code securely`, making them popular among software developers. They enable users to collaborate on different projects by proposing changes, exchanging ideas and voting on requests from other users.
