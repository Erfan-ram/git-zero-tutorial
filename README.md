What is Git and Github?
=======================

Git is an open-source version control system used to track changes in source code. It has the ability to manage both large and small projects, with efficient speed and accuracy. GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for software development using Git.

Git is designed to be simple yet powerful, allowing developers to record change sets that can easily be identified. While Git is mainly used as a command-line tool, GitHub provides tailored user interfaces, including graphical desktop and web applications. GitHub also offers additional functionality such as bug tracking, project management, feature requests, review and wikis.

The main use of Git and GitHub is to store code securely, making them popular among software developers. They enable users to collaborate on different projects by proposing changes, exchanging ideas and voting on requests from other users.
